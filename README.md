### View project details

The sidebar will be your main navigation tool.

All projects for which you have created as an author or are a collaborator on will appear on the sidebar underneath the "Project" button/icon.

Each project will have a multi-person icon which will link to the collaborators associated to that specific project.

As you click on each project, update messages specific to that project, will appear below the project name.

Clicking on a specific update message will pull up details on that update message and the document associated to that update.

Please note that all update messages are in reverse order, with the most recent updates appearing first.
