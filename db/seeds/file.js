                    In which I had abandoned the true way.\
                    But after I had reached a mountain's foot,\
                    At that point where the valley terminated,\
                    Which had with consternation pierced my heart,\
                    Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,\
                    Vested already with that planet's rays\
                    Which leadeth others right by every road.\
                    Then was the fear a little quieted\
                    That in my heart's lake had endured throughout\
                    The night, which I had passed so piteously.\
                    And even as he, who, with distressful breath,\
                    Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,\
                    Turns to the water perilous and gazes;\
                    So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,\
                    Turn itself back to re-behold the pass\
                    Which never yet a living person left.\
                    After my weary body I had rested,\
                    The way resumed I on the desert slope,\
                    So that the firm foot ever was the lower.\
                    And lo! almost where the ascent began,\
                    A panther light and swift exceedingly,\
                    Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!\
                    And never moved she from before my face,\
                    Nay, rather did impede so much my way,\
                    That many times I to return had turned.\
                    The time was the beginning of the morning,\
                    And up the sun was mounting with those stars\
                    That with him were, what time the Love Divine\
                    At first in motion set those beauteous things;\
                    So were to me occasion of good hope,\
                    The variegated skin of that wild beast,\
                    The hour of time, and the delicious season;\
                    But not so much, that did not give me fear\
                    A lion's aspect which appeared to me.\
                    He seemed as if against me he were coming\
                    With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,\
                    So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;\
                    And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings\
                    Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,\
                    And many folk has caused to live forlorn!\
                    She brought upon me so much heaviness,\
                    With the affright that from her aspect came,\
                    That I the hope relinquished of the height.\
                    And as he is who willingly acquires,\
                    And the time comes that causes him to lose,\
                    Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,\
                    E'en such made me that beast withouten peace,\
                    Which, coming on against me by degrees\
                    Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.\
                    While I was rushing downward to the lowland,\
                    Before mine eyes did one present himself,\
                    Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.\
                    When I beheld him in the desert vast,\
                    \"Have pity on me,\" unto him I cried,\
                    \"\Whiche'er thou art, or shade or real man!\"\
                    He answered me: \"Not man; man once I was,\
                    And both my parents were of Lombardy,\
                    And Mantuans by country both of them.\
                    'Sub Julio' was I born, though it was late,\
                    And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,\
                    During the time of false and lying gods.\
                    A poet was I, and I sang that just\
                    Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,\
                    After that Ilion the superb was burned.\
                    But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?\
                    Why climb'st thou not the Mount Delectable,\
                    Which is the source and cause of every joy?\"\
                    \"Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain\
                    Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?\"\
                    I made response to him with bashful forehead.\
                  \"O, of the other poets honour and light,\
                    Avail me the long study and great love\
                    That have impelled me to explore thy volume!\
                  Thou art my master, and my author thou,\
                    Thou art alone the one from whom I took\
                    The beautiful style that has done honour to me.\
                  Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;\
                    Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,\
                    For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble.\""

There was never the least attention paid to what was cut up for sausage; there would come all the way back from Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white—it would be dosed with borax and glycerine, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.

There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it. It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together. This is no fairy story and no joke; the meat would be shoveled into carts, and the man who did the shoveling would not trouble to lift out a rat even when he saw one—there were things that went into the sausage in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit. There was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner, and so they made a practice of washing them in the water that was to be ladled into the sausage.

It was stupefying, brutalizing work; it left her no time to think, no strength for anything. She was part of the machine she tended, and every faculty that was not needed for the machine was doomed to be crushed out of existence. There was only one mercy about the cruel grind—that it gave her the gift of insensibility. Little by little she sank into a torpor—she fell silent. She would meet Jurgis and Ona in the evening, and the three would walk home together, often without saying a word. Ona, too, was falling into a habit of silence—Ona, who had once gone about singing like a bird. She was sick and miserable, and often she would barely have strength enough to drag herself home."

It was a thing scarcely to be spoken—a thing never spoken by all the world, that will not know its own defeat. They were beaten; they had lost the game, they were swept aside. It was not less tragic because it was so sordid, because it had to do with wages and grocery bills and rents. They had dreamed of freedom; of a chance to look about them and learn something; to be decent and clean, to see their child grow up to be strong. And now it was all gone—it would never be! They had played the game and they had lost. Six years more of toil they had to face before they could expect the least respite, the cessation of the payments upon the house; and how cruelly certain it was that they could never stand six years of such a life as they were living! They were lost, they were going down—and there was no deliverance for them, no hope; for all the help it gave them the vast city in which they lived might have been an ocean waste, a wilderness, a desert, a tomb. So often this mood would come to Ona, in the nighttime, when something wakened her; she would lie, afraid of the beating of her own heart, fronting the blood-red eyes of the old primeval terror of life. Once she cried aloud, and woke Jurgis, who was tired and cross. After that she learned to weep silently—their moods so seldom came together now! It was as if their hopes were buried in separate graves."

Clearly they were of the opinion that Jack had done the decent thing, had put himself in the right by his generous apology and Ralph, obscurely, in the wrong. They waited for an appropriately decent answer. Yet Ralph's throat refused to pass one. He resented, as an addition to Jack's misbehavior, this verbal trick. The fire was dead, the ship was gone. Could they not see? Anger instead of decency passed his throat. \"That was a dirty trick.\" They were silent on the mountain-top while the opaque look appeared in Jack's eyes and passed away. Ralph's final word was an ingracious mutter. \"All right. Light the fire.\""

There was a lamp in there—light, don’t you know—and outside it was so beastly, beastly dark. I went no more near the remarkable man who had pronounced a judgment upon the adventures of his soul on this earth. The voice was gone. What else had been there? But I am of course aware that next day the pilgrims buried something in a muddy hole. And then they very nearly buried me.\""
